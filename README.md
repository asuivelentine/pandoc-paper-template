# pandoc-paper-template

This is a template for a scientific paper compiled with pandoc. This
repository contains several templates, so one can compile the content into a
default paper, an ASME paper and a HFU paper (template for my university), as
well as into a website.

The idea is to have _one_ content which can be compiled into N paper
templates.

More templates will follow as I need them.

# Thanks

Thanks to the creator of
[vimpreviewpandoc](https://github.com/tex/vimpreviewpandoc), where the plantuml,
blockdiag, seqdiag, actdiag, nwdiag, packetdiag, rackdiag and R support was
taken from.

# Contrib / Support

This repo is public, yes. This repo is GPLv2, yes. But I not care about your
bugs here. If you find a bug, fix it yourself. I'd happily apply patches, as
long as they do not break _my_ workflow, but I won't help you with your problems
as long as this stuff here works for me.

Reason: This is mainly because I have to write thesis, work and some other
commitments. It does not mean that this state will not change, maybe I will
support this at some time in the future, but for now, this is because _I_ need
this functionality.
