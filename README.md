# pandoc-paper-template

This is a template for a scientific paper compiled with pandoc. This
repository contains several templates, so one can compile the content into a
default paper, an ASME paper and a HFU paper (template for my university), as
well as into a website.

The idea is to have _one_ content which can be compiled into N paper
templates.

More templates will follow as I need them.
